# Chatbot

* A chatbot is a conversational agent capable of answering user queries in the form of text, speech, or via a graphical user interface. 
* It is a software application that can chat with a user on any topic.

### Task-oriented chatbots 
* Designed to perform specific tasks. For instance, answer queries related to train reservation, pizza delivery, work as a personal medical therapist or personal assistant.

### General purpose chatbots 
* Can have open-ended discussions with the users.

### Hybrid chatbots 
* Can engage in both task-oriented and open-ended discussion with the users.

## Development approaches

### Learning-based
* Use machine learning techniques and a dataset to learn to generate a response to user queries.
* **Advantage**: Flexibility to answer a variety of user queries, maybe inaccurate.
* **Drawback**: May need a huge amount of time and data to train.

#### Retrieval based chatbots 
* Learn to select a certain response to user queries. 

#### Generative chatbots 
* Learn to generate a response on the fly.

### Rule-based
* There are a specific set of rules. 
* If the user query matches any rule, the answer to the query is generated, otherwise the user is notified that the answer to user query doesn't exist.
* **Advantage**:  Always give accurate results. 
* **Drawback**: Do not scale well. To add more responses, you have to define new rules.
